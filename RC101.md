# RC101: Packaging an analysis

## Learning goals

1.  Install the prerequisite tools and software
2.  Describe a *research compendium*

## Prerequisites

1.  [RStudio ≥1.4](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

2.  [R ≥4.0](https://cran.r-project.org/)

3.  tidyverse `install.packages("tidyverse")`

4.  devtools `install.packages("devtools")`

    devtools can be a pain to install the first time. If you run into installation issues, you probably need to install [Rtools4](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) (if you're on Windows) or the Xcode command line tools (if you're on a Mac). *Don't* install the whole Xcode suite; it's 40GB of mostly stuff you don't need. Install *just* the command line tools by running `xcode-select --install` at the Terminal (not the R console).

7.  rrtools `devtools::install_github("benmarwick/rrtools")`

## Describe a research compendium

The research compendium is a framework for packaging the code, data, and manuscript for an analysis following a field's conventions. To understand the motivation for and implementation of research compendia, you have two options. You can read [Marwick et al. (2018)](Marwick%20et%20al.%20(2018)") or watch 3:25 - 13:25 of the following ROpenSci Community Call, where Marwick presents that paper.
